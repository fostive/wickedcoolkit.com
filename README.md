## Local Dev

This is an express site with all the assets in [`/public`](./public). Run `npm run build` to build the assets and specify `NODE_ENV=production` when doing a production build. Run `npm start` to start a server that will serve that directory and the html templates. You can specify a port by setting `PORT` env var.
